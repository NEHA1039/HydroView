## 🌊 HydroView: Real-Time Groundwater Evaluation System 

This is a 15-day "Build in Public" challenge to create a full-stack Proof of Concept for **HydroView**, a system designed to help tackle India's critical groundwater crisis.

**The Problem:** India has 5,000+ Digital Water Level Recorders (DWLRs), but this data is often complex and not easily accessible for decision-makers.

**The Solution:** This project simulates a real-time dashboard to visualize this data, providing a simple, actionable interface (maps, charts, status) for policymakers and researchers.

**Tech Stack:**
* **Backend:** Java / Spring Boot
* **Frontend:** React
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
